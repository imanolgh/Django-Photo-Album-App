# Django Photo Album App
Welcome to my photo album app.  This app runs on Django and supports user registration and login, as well as uploading, viewing, and deleting images.  Users can create albums for their photos, search photos by album, and add captions for their photos.  The database used to store the images is the build-in database Django comes with out of the box.
